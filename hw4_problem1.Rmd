Feben Asefaha (fta2112) is the lead for Problem 1, and Nadiya Pavlishyn (np2547) is the collaborator.

###Problem 1
```{r load libraries and data, include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(readxl)
library(haven)
library(janitor)

#loading data
pups_data <- read_csv("./FAS_pups.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()

#gathering variables and omitting blank observations

pups_data_tidy = gather(pups_data, key = pd_measure, value = pd_outcome, pd_ears:pd_walk) %>% filter(!is.na(pd_outcome))

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



```{r include=FALSE}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
